Hey, Iâ€™m Marissa

Iâ€™m a Quality Assurance Solutions Engineer with a background in mechanical engineering and a strong focus on computational design, automation, and problem-solving. I have a deep interest in home automation, building efficient workflows, and figuring out how things work. My work primarily involves scripting and automation, particularly in Marionette for Vectorworks.

What I Do

	â€¢	Scripting & Automation â€“ Writing and refining scripts to improve workflows
	â€¢	Quality Assurance â€“ Ensuring software reliability and usability
	â€¢	Computational Design â€“ Applying algorithmic approaches to problem-solving
	â€¢	Home Automation â€“ Optimizing smart home setups for efficiency and convenience
	â€¢	Fixing Things - Debugging software, repairing old clocks, and finding better solutions

Tech Stack

	â€¢	Languages: Python, JavaScript, Vectorscript
	â€¢	Tools & Frameworks: Vectorworks Marionette, Node.js, Git, Obsidian
	â€¢	Home Automation: IFTTT, SmartThings, Google Home routines, Lutron, Hue

What Iâ€™m Working On

	â€¢	Learning more about backend development for Marionette
	â€¢	Becoming more familiar with Arduino and controllers for automation projects
	â€¢	Repairing mechanical clocks
	â€¢	Expanding smart home automations
	â€¢	Reducing waste and improving sustainability in daily life

I like solving problems, optimizing systems, and making things work better. If you want to talk about scripting, automation, or anything else interesting, feel free to reach out.
